# Turing ECommerce backend website

In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS. here's the swagger(`https://backendapi.turing.com/docs/#/`), but you need to pass the test for it first here(`https://developers.turing.com/dashboard/challenge`).
I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the customer is valid or not. We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.

## Requirements

## Installation process and Execution

First and foremost, If you'are using Linux-based-OS, open your terminal and install the latest version of NodeJS and npm. You do also need to install mysql database onto your system. by writing the following commands.
This will install NodeJS version-12 and npm version-6 on your system.

       sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl
       sudo apt install build-essential apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates curl
       curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
       sudo apt install nodejs
       
Next, you've to install mysql-database into your system. For this, write these following commands on your terminal.

       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install mysql-server

You can also check the version of NodeJS and npm by writing, `node -v` and `npm -v` on the terminal respectively.
Next, you need to make a clone of this repository and get into the repository on your terminal. Now, you need to install the required dependencies from your `package.json` file. For this, you've to write `sudo npm install`.

There is a `tshirtshop.sql` file already present in the `database/` folder. You have to import this file to an empty database. For this, make a new database first, and navigate to the database/ directory and then write the following commands:
Import the schema using `mysql -u <user_name> -p <database_name> < tshirtshop.sql`
For checking the data, log into your user, by writing `mysql -u <user_name> -p` You would be asked for your password. Now, you can use database with all its tables data.

Next, navigate to the folder where, `server.js`file is located. You can start the local server by writing`node server.js`on the terminal.
You can always kill your running port by writing,`killall -9 node`on the terminal.
Now, you need to install postman, that helps you to develop APIs and getting responses from it, by writing the following commands on your terminal.

       sudo apt-get install snap
       snap install postman
       
Happy coding ):
